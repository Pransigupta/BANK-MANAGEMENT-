# BANK-MANAGEMENT-
A simple, console-based Bank Management System written in modern C++ that demonstrates core OOP concepts, basic persistence (file/JSON-like), and common banking workflows (create account, deposit, withdraw, transfer, close account, and mini-statement). Great for beginners practicing C++, data structures, and clean code.
